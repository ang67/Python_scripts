### Description
**As DevOps, Implement guide of best practice to maintain development project:**
- Docker images maintenance
- CI tools (using GitHub Actions for build, test, push, tag/release)
- CD tools (ArgoCD)
- ...

### Guidance and Best Practices

#### Docker Images Maintenance
1. **Regular Updates:** Keep your Docker images up-to-date with the latest versions to ensure security patches and new features are included.
2. **Automated Builds:** Set up automated builds using CI tools to ensure new commits trigger Docker image builds.
3. **Image Scanning:** Use tools like Trivy or Clair to scan images for vulnerabilities.
4. **Tagging Strategy:** Implement a consistent tagging strategy (e.g., `latest`, `stable`, `v1.0.0`) to manage image versions effectively.
5. **Storage Management:** Periodically clean up unused images and layers to save storage space.

#### CI Tools (GitHub Actions)
1. **Workflow Configuration:** Define workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory using YAML files.
2. **Build and Test:** Set up actions to build the project and run tests on every push or pull request.
3. **Push and Tag:** Automate the process of pushing Docker images to a registry and tagging releases.
4. **Notifications:** Configure notifications for build successes and failures to keep the team informed.
5. **Secrets Management:** Use GitHub Secrets to securely store credentials and sensitive information.

#### CD Tools (ArgoCD)
1. **Application Definitions:** Use declarative GitOps approaches to define the desired state of applications.
2. **Sync Policies:** Configure automatic or manual sync policies based on the requirements.
3. **Monitoring:** Enable application health monitoring and alerts.
4. **Rollbacks:** Implement strategies for easy rollback in case of deployment failures.
5. **Access Control:** Use RBAC policies to manage permissions and access to ArgoCD.

By following these best practices, you can ensure a well-maintained and efficient development process that leverages modern DevOps tools and methodologies.
